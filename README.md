rb.rotate
=========

**rb.rotate** is an alternative to classical `logrotate` tool. 
It brings very similar functionallity, features openess and flexibility 
of the scripting environment and removes some most known `logrotate` 
limitations.

And of sure, it adds some features and it doesn't implement some
features of the original for now.

### Removed `logrotate` Limitations

* log directory and archive directory can be on **different drives**,
* it can **follow symbolic links** both for directories and files,
* it can **respect the subdirectories structure** of the log directory,
  so archive directory can have the same structure as original log 
  directory.
  
### Additional Features

* elegant, well documented and easy-to-understand [YAML][2] configuration 
  file,
* flexible and in fact unlimited possibility to define hooks while 
  "put file to archive" action and run them in mix with pre-build 
  actions in whatever required order.

Status
------
Currently in **pre-beta** version. All features are implemented, some 
of them such as *hooks* are untested.

### Documentation

See the configuration file. It's pretty well documented with possible values
listed and a lot of explaining.
