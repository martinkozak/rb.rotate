        # Guards maximal size of the log. Log is bigger than this value,
        # rotates it. But it keeps other archived logs lifetime, so although 
        # log has been rotated prematurely and number of logs in archive is
        # bigger then 'rotate' settings, it will keep all because 'rotate'
        # settings means only number of 'type' units for keeping the log,
        # nothing more.
        #
        # You can use base units here: 'K', 'M' and 'G' which mean 
        # appropriate quantity of kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes.
        #
        # Default value:
        #   nothing

        ##
        # Says which type of archive distinguisher rotate will use.
        # You can state the 'numeric' identifier, then increasing number
        # will be used, or specify the string in date format syntax.
        #
        # Date formatting directives are following:
        #
        #   %a - The abbreviated weekday name (``Sun'')
        #   %A - The  full  weekday  name (``Sunday'')
        #   %b - The abbreviated month name (``Jan'')
        #   %B - The  full  month  name (``January'')
        #   %c - The preferred local date and time representation
        #   %d - Day of the month (01..31)
        #   %H - Hour of the day, 24-hour clock (00..23)
        #   %I - Hour of the day, 12-hour clock (01..12)
        #   %j - Day of the year (001..366)
        #   %m - Month of the year (01..12)
        #   %M - Minute of the hour (00..59)
        #   %p - Meridian indicator (``AM''  or  ``PM'')
        #   %S - Second of the minute (00..60)
        #   %U - Week  number  of the current year, starting with the 
        #        first Sunday as the first day of the first week (00..53)
        #   %W - Week  number  of the current year, starting with the 
        #        first Monday as the first day of the first week (00..53)
        #   %w - Day of the week (Sunday is 0, 0..6)
        #   %x - Preferred representation for the date alone, no time
        #   %X - Preferred representation for the time alone, no date
        #   %y - Year without a century (00..99)
        #   %Y - Year with century
        #   %Z - Time zone name
        #   %% - Literal ``%'' character    
        #
        # If you type simply 'date', the following format will be used:
        #   %Y%m%d.%H%M
        #
        # Generally are supported all directives as listed in:
        #   http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Time.html#M000298
        # 
        # Default value:
        #   numeric
        #
        # Possible values:
        #   numeric
        #   date
        #   <some formatting string>
        #

        identifier: numeric
        
        ##
        # Says by which actions archive. Some daemons keep logs open, so 
        # there is necessary to copy the old log and truncate the file.
        #
        # One additional option is 'append' which orders appending the 
        # log to existing file. It has sense, of sure, only if the 
        # 'identifier' option is set by appropriate way, so filename in
        # archive storage is static.
        #
        # Be warn, this option works by "programmable" way. Tokens are 
        # evaluated in the order and without thinking about the right sense.
        # So for example 'copy + move' will cause error because of moving 
        # the log to the existing file from previous copying, or 
        # 'truncate + copy' will truncate the file and thereafter copy empty
        # file to archive location which probably isn't the required 
        # behaviour.
        #
        # It's possible to create chains, it isn't limited by number of two
        # operations. Multiline can be achieved by standard YAML syntax.
        # Chains are very useful for hooks.
        #
        # HOOKS
        #
        # But you can use hooks. Hook will get path to the file 
        # generated by preceding built-in operation as parameter 
        # %filepath, so it will get for example path to new file in 
        # archive in case of 'copy' or 'move' or name of the old file 
        # after 'truncate' or 'create'. Hook placed just after 
        # another hook will get parameters defined by YAML encoded 
        # hash array.
        #
        #
        # Possible values:
        #   - move
        #   - append
        #   - create
        #   - remove
        #   - truncate
        #   - hook:<hook name>
        #
        # Default value:
        #   move + create
        #
        
        #action: move + create
        action: copy
